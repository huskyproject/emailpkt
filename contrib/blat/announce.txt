Blat version 1.8     98.10.29  Tim Charron (tcharron@interlog.com)
   1.8 is a merge of 2 different source trees which started diverging
   at version 1.5.  If you're upgrading from the prior "official"
   release, then changes include:

   - Use of "-attach *.ZIP" to send multiple files
   - Use of 'profiles' to store server/userid/n_of_tries/port in the
     registry for multiple profiles.
   - Multiple retries
   - Other changes as described below labeled version 1.6-1.7.9

   If you're upgrading from 1.7.9 at
     http://www.interlog.com/~tcharron/blat.html, then changes include:
   - gwinsock.dll/gensock.dll are no longer needed
   - UUencoding of the main file is possible
   - Graceful termination of connection to smtp server
   - hostname <hst> option to select the hostname used to send the

     specified this way will override any specified with "-port")

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Blat version 1.5 has just been released. This version has the following
enhancements:

 - Two bugs were corrected that made Blat generate exceptions with
   certain CC or BCC adresses.
 - Blat now generates descriptive error messages, rather than the
   infamous "gensock error 4017" type errors
 - Blat now returns an error code when the SMTP session fails
 - A new option -mime was added. This implements the possibility to
   use the MIME quoted-printable transfer encoding. The assumptions
   are:
        1: The file is a text file
        2: The charset is ISO 8859/1

The archive zip file (Intel: Blat15.zip, DEC Alpha: Blat15a.zip) can
be obtained from the usual places (although both SimTel and CICA will
take some time to move the package to the right place). To select the
ftp site near you please use the Blat WWW home page at:

http://gepasi.dbs.aber.ac.uk/softw/Blat.html

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MAILED WITH BLAT 1.5!

Enjoy!
