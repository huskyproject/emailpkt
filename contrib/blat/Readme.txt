DESCRIPTION:

Blat is a Public Domain (generous aren't we?) Windows NT console utility that
sends the contents of a file in an e-mail message using the SMTP protocol.
Blat is useful for creating scripts where mail has to be sent automatically
(CGI, backups, etc.) To use Blat you must have access to a SMTP server via
TCP-IP. Blat uses the a DLL ("gensock" or "gwinsock") from WinVN, the public
domain usenet newsreader for windows. Blat can store a default SMTP server
address and a default "From:" field in the registry. The server's address can
be overriden using the -server flag, and the "From:" address using the -f
flag. Input from the console (stdin) can be used instead of a disk file (if
the special filename '-' is specified). Blat can also "carbon copy" and
"blind carbon copy" the message. Impersonation can be done with the -i flag
which puts the value specified in the "From:" line, however when this is done
the real senders address is stamped in the "Reply-To:" and "Sender:" lines.
This feature can be useful when using the program to send messages from NT
users that are not registered on the SMTP host.

Optionally, blat can also attach multiple binary files to your message.


INSTALLATION:

If you are upgrading from version 1.2 or later, simply copy Blat.exe
over the old one.  Blat no longer needs gensock.dll or gwinsock.dll.
You can delete these unless another application you use requires them.

If you are upgrading from Blat 1.1 or 1.0 (phew!) or you never used Blat before
you must follow these steps:

1) Copy the file "Blat.exe" to your "\WINNT\SYSTEM32" directory, or to any
   other directory in your path.

2) Run "Blat -install yourhost.site.blah.blah youruserid@site.blah.blah"


WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION

Version 1.8.2b 98.11.30
  - Removed all calls in gensock to MessageBox()
  - Fixed timeout when configured for retries.  (was using ms instead of s)

Version 1.8.2a 98.11.20
  - "-q" option was still printing "Attached text file: attach.txt" messages

Version 1.8.2 98.11.17
  - Oops.  was still identifying itself as 1.8
  - Added terminating boundary to any messages with attachments.
  - Autodetection of file types in MIME headers (from
    Toby Korn <tkorn@snl.com>)

Version 1.8.1 98.11.15
  - Fixed Multiline response treatment. (courtesy of Wolfgang
    Schwart <schwart@wmd.de>)
  - Fixed ability to use "-" filenames.  Ctrl-Z detection was broken.
  - Fixed use of "-noh"/"-noh2" option (also broken in 1.8).

Version 1.8     98.10.29
   1.8 is a merge of 2 different source trees which started diverging
   at version 1.5.  If you're upgrading from the prior "official"
   release, then changes include:

   - Use of "-attach *.ZIP" to send multiple files
   - Use of 'profiles' to store server/userid/n_of_tries/port in the
     registry for multiple profiles.
   - Multiple retries
   - Other changes as described below labeled version 1.6-1.7.9

   If you're upgrading from 1.7.9 at
     http://www.interlog.com/~tcharron/blat.html, then changes include:
   - gwinsock.dll/gensock.dll are no longer needed
   - UUencoding of the main file is possible
   - Graceful termination of connection to smtp server
   - hostname <hst> option to select the hostname used to send the
     message
   - Ability to specify port using "server:port" style names. (ports
     specified this way will override any specified with "-port")

Version 1.7.9   98.9.16
 - omission of a terminating boundary was causing some e-mail systems
   to not process the message properly. (Toby Korn tkorn@snl.com)

Version 1.7.8d  98.9.1
 - Added "-noh" command line option to prevent X-Mailer header from
   showing homepage of blat.  Added "-noh2" to prevent X-Mailer
   header entirely

Version 1.7.8c  98.8.25
 - Changed copyright limitations to prohibit use as a spam tool

Version 1.7.8b  98.8.11
 - Cleaned up some wild pointers that was a potential crash
   (although crashes have not been reported, better safe than sorry...)

Version 1.7.8   98.8.8
 - Support for non-standard character sets in the header fields (hopefully).

Version 1.7.7   98.8.8
 - Fixed problem with wildcards/filename parsing when compile with
   Watcom

version 1.7.6
 - Made output cleaner when wildcards used
 - Increased limit on attachments to 64 files.
 - Message Boundary is a random string instead of a fixed string
   (allows sending 2 or more blat messages as attachements to a 3rd
   message using BLAT)

version 1.7.5
 - Added a delay of 15 seconds between retries
 - Added the ability to use wildcards (*.*, ?) in "-attach" and "-attacht" options
 - Changed the way file "-" was read, removing phantom character that was appearing

version 1.7.4
 - Minor correction to return values in the event of server timeout

version 1.7.3
 - Fixed "-attach"ing of largish files (but in calculation of internal
   space required).

version 1.7.2
 - Added "-attacht" which enables attaching multiple files without base64
   encoding them.

version 1.7.1
 - Minor command line parsing bugs fixed

version 1.7
 - Added command line option "-port" to allow usage of a proxy listening on
   many ports and redirecting toward many SMTP servers.
 - Added command line option "-try" to avoid "time-out" error message when
   using phone-line connection or "Too many users connected" error message when
   using a proxy.
 - Added these options to the registry. Added profiles to the registry for ease
   in choosing server, user, retries and port.
 - Added a "-profile" to see the existing profiles.
 - Added a "-profile -delete" to delete a profile.

version 1.6.3
 - Added command line option "-attach" to allow attaching multiple
   binary files to a message.
 - "-base64" causes inclusion via 'attachment' method instead of 'inline'

version 1.6.2
 - Added command line option "-o" to provide Organization field
   in the headers of the sent message.

version 1.6
 - Added support for mailing of binary files (mime base64 encoding)
   which will make it possible to mail ANY file.
 - Fixed argument parsing for '-q' and '-mime' options (these used
   to only work if they were the last argument)

version 1.5
 - Two bugs were corrected that made Blat generate exceptions with certain
   CC or BCC adresses.
 - Blat now generates descriptive error messages, rather than the infamous
   "gensock error 4017" type errors
 - Blat now returns an error code when the SMTP session fails
 - A new option -mime was added. This implements the possibility to use
   the MIME quoted-printable transfer encoding. The assumptions are:
        1: The file is a text file
        2: The charset is ISO 8859/1


USAGE:

syntax:
  Blat <filename> -t <recipient> [optional switches (see below)]
  Blat -install <server addr> <sender's addr> [<try>[<port>[<profile>]]] [-q]
  Blat -profile [-delete | "<default>"] [profile1] [profileN] [-q]
  Blat -h [-q]

-install <server addr> <sender's addr> [<try n times> [<port> [<profile>]]]
     : set's SMTP server, sender, number of tries and port for profile
       (<try n times> and <port> may be replaced by '-').

<filename>    : file with the message body ('-' for console input, end with ^Z)
-t <recipient>: recipient list (comma separated)
-s <subj>     : subject line
-f <sender>   : overrides the default sender address (must be known to server)
-i <addr>     : a 'From:' address, not necessarily known to the SMTP server.
-c <recipient>: carbon copy recipient list (comma separated)
-b <recipient>: blind carbon copy recipient list (comma separated)
-o <organization>: Organization field
-h            : displays this help.
-q            : supresses *all* output.
-noh          : prevent X-Mailer header from showing homepage of blat
-noh2         : prevent X-Mailer header entirely
-p <profile>  : send with SMTP server, user and port defined in <profile>.
-server <addr>: overrides the default SMTP server to be used. (optionally, server:port)
-port <port>  : port to be used on the server, defaults to SMTP (25)
-hostname <hst>: select the hostname used to send the message
-mime         : MIME Quoted-Printable Content-Transfer-Encoding.
-uuencode      : Send (binary) file UUEncoded
-base64        : Send (binary) file using base64 (binary Mime)
-try <n times>: how many time blat should try to send. from '1' to 'INFINITE'
-attach <file>: attach binary file to message (may be repeated)
-attacht <file>: attach text file to message (may be repeated)

Note that if the '-i' option is used, <sender> is included in 'Reply-to:'
and 'Sender:' fields in the header of the message.

EXAMPLES:

Blat -install smtphost.bar.com foo@bar.com          // Sets host and userid
Blat -install smtphost.bar.com foo                  // Sets host and userid
Blat -install smtphost.bar.com                      // Sets host only

Blat myfile.txt -s "A file for pedro" -t foo@bar.com
// Sends a file with subject line "A file for pedro"

Blat myfile.txt -s "A file for pedro" -t foo@bar.com -q
// Sends a file with subject line "A file for pedro" and does not print
// informative messages on the console

Blat myfile.txt -s "A file for mark" -t fee@fi.com -f foo@bar.com
// -f option overrides the default sender

Blat myfile.txt -s "A file for pedro" -t foo@bar.com -i "devil@fire.hell"
// -i replaces "From:" line address (but leaves Reply-To: and Sender: lines)

Blat myfile.txt -s "animals" -t fee@fi.com -c "moo@grass.edu,horse@meadow.hill"
// -c mails carbon copies to users moo@grass.edu and horse@meadow.hill

Blat.exe BLAT.ZIP -s "file to gil" -t foo@bar.com -base64
// Sends the binary file BLAT.ZIP to Gilles in MIME Base 64 format

Blat.exe BLAT.ZIP -s "file to gil" -t foo@bar.com -uuencode
// Sends the binary file BLAT.ZIP to Gilles in the old UUEncode format

Blat myfile.txt -s "oumpla" -t foo@bar.com -attach c:\myfolder\*.txt
// Sends a file with subject line "oumpla", attach all files with extension "TXT"
// in folder "myfolder" on drive "C:". Note: you must specify a filename/pattern,
// "-attach .\*.*" will send all files in current folder.
// "-attach ." will not send anything AND WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANY WARNING.

Blat myfile.txt -t fee@fi.com -server smtp.domain.com -port 6000
// sends the message through SMTP server smtp.domain.com at port 6000

Blat myfile.txt -t fee@fi.com -hostname friend
// tells the SMTP that this computer is called "friend"
