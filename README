 1. What is EmailPKT?
 --------------------
 
  EmailPKT is a program to send & receive FTN bundles (echomail, netmail,
  tics and files in general) via e-mail. It sends outgoing files as MIME
  Base64 attachments that can be decoded and processed either manually with
  a normal email client or automatically with any software like EmailPKT. To
  receive incoming files, it reads the standard input and processes emails
  with either MIME attachments or UUENCODED files.
  

 1.1. Why Email routing?
 -----------------------
 
  If you have a link that is not in your same city or even in your same
  country, using normal phone calls would be a big waste of money. Using the
  Internet to route is the way to solve this problem. Here comes Fido-over-IP
  mailers like BinkD and Argus, but they have another problem. At least one of
  the two systems must be on-line 24 hours a day. When using e-mail routing,
  there are no long distance bills and there is no need of the both ends to be
  always on-line.

  Of course, email routing is not the best way of routing. The traffic
  generated is 30% more than the used for example in BinkD and there is no
  simple and 100% compatible with other software way of authentication.
  Nevertheless, it is a good idea to have an email system set up even if you
  have no need of it today (maybe tomorrow you will need it).



 2. Compiling & installing EmailPKT
 ----------------------------------

  Currently, EmailPKT works only under Linux (and hopefully in any kind of
  Unix). Future ports to non-Unix system could be (and should be) done in the
  (not so near) future.

  EmailPKT can be installed either standalone or with Husky support. The
  source distribution is the same for the two versions, but the installed
  version depends on the makefile used to compile the program.


 2.1. With HUSKY support
 -----------------------
 
  It is recommended that you install EmailPKT with HUSKY support only if you
  already have a working version of at least fidoconf. If not, go to the
  standalone section.

  Husky is a joint effort of over a dozen developers from Germany, Russia and
  all over the world to develop a completely free, open-sourced and portable
  fidonet software suite.  Husky currently runs on Linux, FreeBSD and many
  other free and commercial Unix systems, and also on OS/2, Windows and DOS,
  and features a state of the art tosser, ticker, and various other useful
  fidonet utilties.
  
  It is based on a single configuration file that can be used by many
  different programs. So, if EmailPKT is compiled with HUSKY support you will
  have a lot of work already done (assuming you have a working config file).
  
  To compile the program with HUSKY support, you will need huskymak.cfg that
  comes in the huskybse package. It can be downloaded from
  http://husky.physcip.uni-sttutgart.de in the huskybse section.
  
  Take a look at it and its comments, and change whatever you want to meet
  your needs.
  
  Assuming you have already instaled at least one package from HUSKY, the
  compiling process for EmailPKT is the same. Note that the makefile that
  must be used is called 'makefile', so you do not have to worry about extra
  arguments to make.

    $ make
    $ make install
    $ make distclean
  
  Refer to INSTALL guide in huskybse for more information.

  
 2.2. Standalone
 ---------------
 
  If you do not have a working HUSKY environment or do not want to use it,
  you can use EmailPKT with an own config file instead of using a common one.
  
  To compile the program standalone, you must use another makefile. The default
  one ('makefile') is used to compile a HUSKY dependant version. Right now, the
  only target platform for the standalone version is Linux, so the makefile to
  use is called 'makefile.lnx' (Hey, you Unix guru! Change it and mail me back
  your legacy makefile!). Thus, the steps to compile EmailPKT are:
  
    $ make -f makefile.lnx
    $ make -f makefile.lnx install
    $ make -f makefile.lnx distclean
    
  The binary will be installed in /usr/local/bin by default. Edit the makefile
  and change the variables as you want.

  
 3. How to configure EmailPKT
 ----------------------------
 
 3.1. Fidoconf keywords
 ----------------------
 
  EmailPKT will use the following fidoconf keywords if available:
  
     sysop
     address
     protinbound
     tempinbound
     outbound
     tempoutbound
     logfiledir        - Optional (if none specified, logging is off)
     
  For each link that you want to route via e-mail, specify an email address
  for him. If you do not want to route via e-mail with a link, do not give
  an email address. For example:
  
      Link	Joe Sysop
      Aka	4:905/100
      ourAka	4:905/210
      Email	joe@fidonet.org

  EmailPKT _will_ route files to this link via e-mail.
  
      Link      Pepe Bondiola
      Aka	4:905/209
      ourAka	4:905/210
      
  EmailPKT _won't_ route files to this link via e-mail.

  If for some reason you do no want to use the values above, you can override
  fidoconf by using an EmailPKT own config file. See below.


 3.2. Standalone
 ---------------
 
  To let EmailPKT know where the config file is, you must set an environment
  variable called EMAILPKT with the full path to it. For example, in your
  ~/.bash_profile you should write:
  
    EMAILPKT=/home/fido/cfg/email.cfg
    export EMAILPKT
    
  If it is not set, EmailPKT will try to open "/usr/local/etc/email.cfg". If
  boths methods fail, it will exit with an error.
  
  The config file uses the following keywords:
  
    Name <string>
      The sysop name (Optional)
      
    AKA <aka>
      The main address of the system
      
    Email <string>
      Email address of the system (Optional)
      
    Subject <string>
      Subject of outgoing messages (Optional)

    Inbound <string>
      Protected inbound directoy
             
    TempInbound <string>
      Temporary inbound directoy
       
    Outbound <string>
      Binkley Style base outbound directoy (for the same zone as main aka)
             
    TempOutbound <string>
      Temporary outbound directoy
  
    LogDir <string>
      Directory for storing logs (Optional). If none is given, logging is off.
             
    Link <aka> <email> <name>
      Defintion of link. The first token is the link's aka, the second one is
      the link's email and the third one is the link's name.
      
  Notes:
    *  Keywords are CaSe InSeNsItIvE.
    *  AKAs can be 3d, 4d or 5d. 
    *  In all cases, EmailPKT config overrides Fidoconf.
      
 4. How to use it
 ----------------
 
 4.1. Sending
 ------------
 
  To send all the files that are waiting in the outbound to the links
  specified in the configuration, you must simply call EmailPKT like this:
   
     $ emailpkt send
     
  So, you can easily add to your mailing scripts the above line and you are
  done. E.g.:
     
     $ cat send
     hpt scan
     hpt pack
     emailpkt send
     $
     

 4.2. Receiving
 --------------
  
  The receiving part of EmailPKT acts like a filter. You can call it from
  from the ~/.forward file or from procmail.
    
 4.2.1. ~/.forward
 -----------------
  
  If you have a dedicated account, then you can call EmailPKT directly from
  the ~/.forward file:
    
      $ cat ~/.forward file
      "|/usr/local/bin/emailpkt receive"
      $

  Notes:
      *  You need to put the full path to EmailPKT.
      *  The quotes are needed.
      *  There must be no space between the pipe character (|) and the
         path to EmailPKT.
	 
 4.2.2. procmail
 ---------------
  
  If do not have a dedicated account, you must pipe to EmailPKT some mails
  only. To do this with procmail, add a new rule to your ~/.procmail:
     
       LOGFILE=/home/fido/logs/procmail.log
       EMAILPKT=/home/fido/cfg/email.cfg
     
       :0
       * ^Subject.*FIDO
       | emailpkt receive
       
  Of course, you must change the second line to one that suits you. For
  more information, refer to procmail documentation. A procmailrc example is
  provided with this package. Just change some variables and copy it to
  ~/.procmailrc for a quick start.
     
  Because of an extrange reason, procmail does not see any external
  environment variable. So if you are using the standalone version of EmailPKT,
  you must write again the path to the config file if it is not in
  /usr/local/etc.

     
 4.3. Owner problems
 -------------------
  
  Processing all the email with a user and having all the fido stuff with
  another one is a common practise. So, it is a mistake to try to write in
  another user's directory, and a security hole to let everyone write in the
  inbound directory. To solve this in an easy way, you can pipe all the mails
  from user A that process the email (for example, runs fetchmail) to user B
  (the owner of the inbound directory), and then yes, in user's B ~/.forward
  finally call emailpkt.
     
  For example, user A ~/.procmailrc:
     
       ---cut---
       :0
       * ^Subject.*FIDO
       ! B
       
       :0
       * ^Subject.*Routing
       ! B
       ---cut---
       
       [...]
       
  And user B ~/.forward:
  
       ---cut---
       "|/usr/local/bin/emailpkt receive"
       ---cut---

 5. Notes about the program behaviour
 ------------------------------------

   *  Actually, it is compatible with almost any kind of decent software that
      produces standard information. EmailPKT follows RFC 1349 and has been
      tested with common email software.

   *  It will sure fail when dealing with non-sense information such as
      malformed headers or bad encodings.

   *  Be carefull with directory permissions! You will loose data if EmailPKT
      cannot write to a directory.

   *  Outgoing attachments are always BASE64. It generates bigger data, but it
      is an Internet standard and almost any program can handle MIME.
      UUENCODING is smaller, but nor standard nor every program is capable of
      decoding it.

   *  EmailPKT understands PLAIN TEXT, BASE64, QUOTED-PRINTABLE and UUENCODING.

   *  Incoming and outgoing email plain texts will be kept as a backup feature
      in the temporary inbound and outbound directories. A weekly deletion is
      recommended.

   *  I am not responsable of any data lost caused either by human or computer
      faults. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
