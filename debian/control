Description: Send FTN bundles via mail.
 EmailPKT is a program to send & receive FTN bundles (echomail, netmail,
 tics and files in general) via e-mail. It sends outgoing files either as
 MIME Base64 or UUE attachments that can be decoded and processed either
 manually with a normal email client or automatically with any software like
 EmailPKT. To receive incoming files, it reads the standard input and
 processes emails with either MIME attachments (base64, quoted printable or
 plain text) or UUENCODED files.
