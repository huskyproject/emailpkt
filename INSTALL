Instructions to build emailpkt from sources.
--------------------------------------------

0. The smapi and the fidoconfig packages is required for the emailpkt package.
   They must be already compiled (and installed if uses shared libraries).
   These libraries must be the exactly same version as emailpkt (and date for
   -current branch).

1. Put the emailpkt package in the directory where the other packages of fido
   husky reside:

   unix, beos, cygwin:
   -------------------
   /usr/src/packages/        -> huskybse/
                             -> smapi/
                             -> fidoconfig/
                             -> emailpkt/
                             ...some other

   windows, os/2 & etc:
   -------------------------
   d:\husky\                 -> smapi\
                             -> fidoconf\
                             -> emailpkt\
                             ...some other

2. Determine which makefile you need to use then compile (and install if need)
   fidoconfig using selected makefile, as following examples:
   Example 1 (use common makefile (named 'Makefile'): require huskymak.cfg (see
              huskybse); unixes only):
	$ make
	$ make install
   Example 2 (use platfom-specific makefile from make subdirectory):
   linux:
        $ cd make
	$ make -f makefile.lnx
	$ make -f makefile.lnx install
   dos (DJGPP GCC):
        d:\husky\emailpkt\make>make -f makefile.djg
   windows (MS Visual C/C++):
        d:\husky\emailpkt\make>nmake -f makefile.mvc

5. Write a fido config according to the documentation of fidoconfig and
   emailpkt. Always test the config after changes with the tparser tool
   (from fidoconfig package).

You're ready.


Instructions to use precompiled binary packages.
------------------------------------------------

0. The smapi and the fidoconfig packages is required for the emailpkt package.
   They must be already compiled (and installed if uses shared libraries).
   These libraries must be the exactly same version as emailpkt (and date for
   -current branch).

1. If you already have precompiled binaries - just unpack packages:
   smapi, fidoconfig and emailpkt. All unpack into same directory!

2. Copy config example into binaries directory, edit your config and test the
config with the tparser tool (from fidoconfig package).

You're ready.
