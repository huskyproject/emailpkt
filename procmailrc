# Sample .procmailrc file for calling emailpkt to automatically receive
# FTN packets via email.
# Copy and rename it to ~/.procmailrc

# It is a good idea to have a log when something goes wrong

LOGFILE=/home/fido/logs/procmail.log

# You must declare here the full path to the EmailPKT config file if you
# want to use it, _even_ if you have already set the EMAILPKT environment
# value before. I don't know why, simply procmail ignores it...

#EMAILPKT=$HOME/cfg/email.cfg

# Here's the main thing.
# Of course, you should change this regexp for one that suits you. See
# procmail man page for details.
